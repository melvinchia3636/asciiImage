# Convert any image to ASCII art

I'm too lazy to write the documentation.

Basically it's a tiny module that allows you to convert any image into an image fulfilled by ASCII characters.

Perhaps I'll take some time and add some more content into the documentation in the future. Please remind me if I forgot.
